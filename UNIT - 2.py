#Pseudocode
#Pseudocode is like english/logic. We use it to express code in a more understandable manner.
#Example: "SET score TO 0", which translates to, "score=0"
# -Keep it clear and simple
# -Use indentation to show structure
# -Focus on logic, not syntax
# -Comment your thoughts in plain English
