# Analysis
## Scenario: Imagine your class raises money for a good cause each month. You have a list of how much money (a number) you raised in each month of the year. 
# 
### How can you figure out which month raised the most money?
- You can list out every single month's revenue on a list and compare every single value to deduct the highest income

- Another method to discern the highest value is placing all the values on a bar chart. This allows you to **see** the results and which is the highest value by noting which bar is the highest or longest

# 
### What steps would you take to use and organise these numbers to find the answer?
- A method to organize the values is placing all the values on a bar chart. This allows you to **see** the results by discering which are higher or lower. After you see these values, you can organize them from highest to lowest or lowest to highest on the graph

- Another method is refering to your list of revenues. After viewing this list you can sort them out from highest to lowest or the opposite

## -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Evaluation
## Scenario: Your class is choosing between two field trips: a museum or a zoo. The class votes on the options (each student picks one). 

#
### How would you organise and use the voting results (the number of votes for each option) to decide which trip is more popular?
- In order to organize the results, the most efficient method would be to create a digital form to view the results efficiently without needing to write the results as the application will inform us which is more popular
- Another less efficient method is listing all the results on a piece of paper and tallying them up to see which is more popular
#
### What information would you compare to evaluate the best choice for the class?
- I would compare the 2 votings for the zoo or the museum and percieve which side had more votes and which the students would prefer

# Application
## Scenario: You are planning a class party. What data would you collect to help plan (for example, the number of people coming, each person's favorite snack, and if anyone has an allergy yes/no)? 
#
### What data would you collect to help plan?
- People that are attending
- Allergies
- Cost of food and decorations
- Average consumption
#
### How would you organise this information to decide how much food and drink to get and make sure everyone has something they can enjoy?
- I would organise this info by placing it on a spreedsheet and getting excel to just sort the info for me. I would also gather all this info to figure out everyones average consumption rate allowing me to see how much food to buy. We can also use cost and allergies to discern what food to buy so that we don't waste too much money
#
### Extra
- After we choose what food to buy, we can decide an entry fee to help lessen the loss in money for the school, possibly gaining funds
