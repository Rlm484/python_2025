# Analysis
## Scenario: Imagine your class raises money for a good cause each month. You have a list of how much money (a number) you raised in each month of the year.

## Scenario: Imagine your class raises money for a good cause each month. You have a list of how much money (a number) you raised in each month of the year.
#
### How can you figure out which month raised the most money?
- You can list out every single month's revenue on a list and compare every single value to deduct the highest income




- Another method to discern the highest value is placing all the values on a bar chart. This allows you to **see** the results and which is the highest value by noting which bar is the highest or longest

#
### What steps would you take to use and organise these numbers to find the answer?
- A method to organize the values is placing all the values on a bar chart. This allows you to **see** the results by discerning which are higher or lower. After you see these values, you can organize them from highest to lowest or lowest to highest on the graph




- Another method is referring to your list of revenues. After viewing this list you can sort them out from highest to lowest or the opposite

# Evaluation
## Scenario: Your class is choosing between two field trips: a museum or a zoo. The class votes on the options (each student picks one).

# Evaluation
## Scenario: Your class is choosing between two field trips: a museum or a zoo. The class votes on the options (each student picks one).
#
### How would you organise and use the voting results (the number of votes for each option) to decide which trip is more popular?
- In order to organize the results, the most efficient method would be to create a digital form to view the results efficiently without needing to write the results as the application will inform us which is more popular
















- Another less efficient method is listing all the results on a piece of paper and tallying them up to see which is more popular
#
### What information would you compare to evaluate the best choice for the class?
- I would compare the 2 votings for the zoo or the museum and perceive which side had more votes and which the students would prefer

# Application
## Scenario: You are planning a class party. What data would you collect to help plan (for example, the number of people coming, each person's favorite snack, and if anyone has an allergy yes/no)?
## Scenario: You are planning a class party. What data would you collect to help plan (for example, the number of people coming, each person's favorite snack, and if anyone has an allergy yes/no)?
#
### What data would you collect to help plan?
- People that are attending
















- Allergies
















- Cost of food and decorations
















- Average consumption
#
### How would you organise this information to decide how much food and drink to get and make sure everyone has something they can enjoy?


#
### Extra
- After we choose what food to buy, we can decide an entry fee to help lessen the loss in money for the school, possibly gaining funds
## -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Synthesis
## Scenario: Your teacher has one list of students with perfect attendance and another list of students with top grades. Both lists are names (text data).
#
### How could you put these two lists together to find out which students are on both lists?
- I would place all the info on a document and then put them together using a venn diagram. This visualizes clearly who has both elements.
#
### Why would it help to organise the names clearly (for example, alphabetically or in a table) when looking for students that appear in both sets of data?
- It helps to organize the students from a-z due to us being able to sort both top grades and perfect attendance at once, allowing us to visualize the results along the way.

# Critical Thinking
## Scenario: Imagine a toy ad says, "90% of kids love this toy!" You find out they only asked 10 kids and 9 said they loved it (yes).
#
### What might be wrong or unfair about this data?
- They might have asked kids who only have that specific toy, or those kids are being bribed. We just can't guarantee the legitimacy, especially with hardly any data from an incredible sauce.
#
### What questions would you ask before believing the adâ€™s claim (for example, Is 10 kids a big enough sample? Did they ask a fair mix of different kids?)?
- My main question is what is the relationship of the children to the company that makes the toys. Contractual? Familial? Friendly?
#
### Explain why you would or wouldn't trust this claim based on the data.
- Given the fact they seem to have deliberately chosen 10 kids, it seems they only chose these children so that they can score a higher rating for their product.
## -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Creative Thinking
## Scenario: Imagine you want to get everyone to read more books by holding a fun contest at school. Think of a creative way to use data in this contest. For example, you could track how many pages or books each class reads (numbers) or have students vote for their favorite book (yes/no votes or a list of titles).
#
### What data would you collect?
- I would collect which genre the students like the most by creating a competition that allows you to read a book of choice in class for 10-30 minutes. Whoever reads the most books wins, and we can gather the most popular genre people are reading to encourage more students. We can do this by buying more books of that genre for the library. This competition will last for a month.
#
### How would you use it to make the reading contest both fair and exciting?
- I would make it fair by allowing students to register their books and page onto the ledger teachers have. This would mean teachers can observe what genre they are reading while making it exciting because students can read whatever book they want and miss class for 10-30 minutes to do something they enjoy for a month.
