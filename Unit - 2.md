Pseudocode
Pseudocode is like english/logic. We use it to express code in a more understandable manner.
Example: "SET score TO 0", which translates to, "score=0"
-Keep it clear and simple
-Use indentation to show structure
-Focus on logic, not syntax
-Comment your thoughts in plain English

Guidelines
1. BEGIN/END: Used to denote the start and end of the pseudocode process.
3. IF/THEN/ELSE/ENDIF: Represents conditional logic.
4. FOR/ENDFOR: Indicates the beginning and end of a loop structure.
5. SET: Assigns a value to a variable.
6. ADD: Typically used to add values or items.
8. PRINT: Outputs information or results.
